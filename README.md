**Abstract of the paper.** We introduce a *SAGBI detection* algorithm, analogous to the *Gröbner basis detection* algorithm of Gritzmann and Sturmfels. We also present the accompanying package `SagbiGbDetection` implemented in both `Macaulay2` and `Julia`. The package provides functions to find a term order $\omega$ such that the given generators of an ideal form a Gröbner basis or the given generators of a finitely generated subalgebra of a polynomial ring are the SAGBI basis with respect to $\omega$. In addition, we investigate the complexity and provide several benchmarks that showcase the practical application of this package.

[Here](SAGBIGbDetection_Examples.rst), we present the codes for the examples from the applications section. Our code is written either in the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/) or [Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com/).
