**Abstract of the paper.** We introduce a *SAGBI detection* algorithm, analogous to the *Gröbner basis detection* algorithm of Gritzmann and Sturmfels. We also present the accompanying package `SagbiGbDetection` implemented in both  ``Macaulay2`` and  ``Julia``. The package provides functions to find a term order :math:`\omega` such that the given generators of an ideal form a Gröbner basis or the given generators of a finitely generated subalgebra of a polynomial ring are the SAGBI basis with respect to :math:`\omega`. In addition, we investigate the complexity and provide several benchmarks that showcase the practical application of this package.

In the following we present the codes for the examples from the applications section. Our code is written either in the programming language `julia <https://julialang.org/>`_ or `macaulay2 <https://macaulay2.com/>`_.
